I'm currently trying to get my hands on more and more backend web developement tools and in this I'm in the "node phase". :P
<hr>
This Repositary contains my mini-projects based on node.js and express.

# Usage
- Clone the repositary
```
    git clone https://github.com/anurag-ux/nodejs-mini-projects.git`
```
- go to the cloned folder and install the dependancies.
```
    cd nodejs-mini-projects
    npm install
```
- thats it! now you can run any project just by typing
```
    node {filename.js}
 ```
# Enjoy!

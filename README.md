I'm currently trying to get my hands on more and more backend web developement tools and in this I'm in the "node phase". :P
This Repositary contains my mini-projects based on node.js and express.

# Usage
- 1) Clone the repo
- 2) go to the cloned folder and type "npm install" in the terminal.
- 3) thats it! now you can run any project just by typing "node {filename.js}".
# Enjoy!
